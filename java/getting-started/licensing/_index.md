### **Evaluation Version Limitations**
Evaluation version of Aspose.TeX (without a license specified) provides full product functionality except that only up to four first pages can be obtained in output document. Also, those pages will be stamped with evaluation mode watermark.

If you want to try Aspose.TeX out without evaluation limitations, request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) for more information.

### **Apply License using File or Stream Object**
Use the [License.setLicense](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/License#setLicense-java.lang.String-) method to license the component. The easiest way to set a license is to put the license file in the same folder as the *aspose.tex.jar* and specify the filename, without a path, as shown below.
