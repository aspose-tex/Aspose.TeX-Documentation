And yet another supported target format is [**SVG**](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG). **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation.

**SVG** images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. This means that **SVG** images can be scaled in size without loss of quality, and **SVG** files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors. Thay are rendered by the most-used web browsers.

Also, there is the [**Aspose.SVG**](https://products.aspose.com/svg/) library that has various features based on the **SVG** format. These include creating, loading, editing and converting **SVG** documents.

## **How to convert LaTeX to SVG**

The conversion to SVG is just as simple as [conversion to raster image formats](/tex/java/latex-to-image/), except that in addition to the [SaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXOptions#getSaveOptions--), we have to change the device to an instance of the [SvgDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex.rendering/SvgDevice) class.
