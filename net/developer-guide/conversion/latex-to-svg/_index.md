## **How to convert LaTeX to SVG**

And yet another supported target format is [SVG](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG). The LaTeX to SVG conversion is also as simple as [conversion to raster image formats](/tex/net/latex-to-image/), except that the [SaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex/texoptions/saveoptions/) MUST be set to an [SvgSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex.presentation.svg/svgsaveoptions/) class instance, and the device MUST be changed to an instance of the [SvgDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex.presentation.svg/svgdevice/) class.
