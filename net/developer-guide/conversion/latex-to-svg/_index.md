And yet another supported target format is [**SVG**](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG). **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation.

**SVG** images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. **SVG** images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and **SVG** files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by the most-used web browsers.

There is the [**Aspose.SVG**](https://products.aspose.com/svg/) library that provides various features related to **SVG**. These include creating, loading, editing and converting **SVG** documents.

## **How to convert LaTeX to SVG**

The LaTeX to SVG conversion is also as simple as the [conversion to raster image formats](/tex/net/latex-to-image/), except that the [SaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex/texoptions/saveoptions/) MUST be set to an [SvgSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex.presentation.svg/svgsaveoptions/) class instance, and the device MUST be changed to an instance of the [SvgDevice](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/net/aspose.tex.presentation.svg/svgdevice/) class.
